      <h3>
        You were asked the following : 
      </h3>
      <p class = "ques">
        Is this the first coding school Matthew has attended?
      </p>
      <p class = "ans">
        Prior to CodeFellows, Matthew had never attended a coding school.
      </p>
      <p class = "ques">
        Does Matthew enjoy cooking?
      </p>
      <p class="ans">
        One of Matthew's favorite past times is to cook and loves to look at cookbooks for new recipes. 
      </p>
      
      <p class = "ques">
        Wow. Matthew seems like a fire sign. Is Matthew a Leo?
      </p>
      
      <p class = "ans">
        Matthew is not a fire sign. Matthew was born on June 25th which makes him a Cancer and a water sign. Matthew does not place much value on Zodialogical signs , so you can still be friends (even if you are a fire sign).
      </p>
      
      <p class = "ques">
        Is Matthew from Seattle?
      </p>
      <p class="ans">
        Matthew was born in the city of Seattle, and has spent the majority of his time in and around the Seattle area. 
      </p>
      <p class = "ques">
        So Matthew is from Seattle. Does Matthew watch the M's?
      </p>
      <p class="ans">
        Matthew is not a fan of team sports, so he won't be watching the M's but he loves a good game.
